# Welcome to Kazafi

Using **#EBE9E3 (light beige)** for the product background and **#F3F2ED (soft grayish-white)** for the product page background creates a **neutral, elegant, and minimalistic** look. To ensure a **consistent and aesthetically pleasing color scheme** across the homepage, consider the following modifications:

---

### **🎨 1. Define a Primary & Secondary Color**

Since your **product page uses soft neutrals**, your homepage needs:  
✅ **A Primary Color** → This should be a bold or elegant shade that **grabs attention** (e.g., buttons, headlines).  
✅ **A Secondary Color** → A complementary color for accents (e.g., hover states, borders, subtle highlights).

🔹 **Suggested Colors:**

- **Primary (Brand Accent Color)**: Deep **navy blue** `#2B3A42`, muted **teal** `#3A5A40`, or classic **black** `#222222` (for contrast).
- **Secondary (Soft Contrast)**: Dusty **gold** `#B2996E`, muted **olive green** `#A6A57A`, or a warm **terracotta** `#C16E4D`.

These will **complement** your neutral background while keeping the design clean and modern.

---

### **🌅 2. Background Adjustments for the Homepage**

Your homepage needs **slight variations** in the background to avoid looking too washed out:

- **Hero Section:** Use a **slightly warmer** or **textured** background like `#F5F3EF` instead of plain white.
- **Call-to-Action Sections (e.g., Featured Products, Testimonials, Newsletter Signup):** A **subtle contrasting block** (`#E6E4DB` or `#D9D7CE`) to create depth.

---

### **🎯 3. Text & Typography Adjustments**

Since your background colors are **soft**, text colors should ensure **readability and contrast**:

- **Headings:** Dark **charcoal (#2B2B2B)** or deep **navy (#1A2930)** for bold contrast.
- **Body Text:** Neutral **dark gray (#4A4A4A)** instead of pure black.
- **Buttons & Links:** Use your **Primary Color (#3A5A40, #2B3A42, or #C16E4D)** to make CTA buttons **stand out**.

**Example:**  
🛒 **"Shop Now" Button** → Background: `#C16E4D` (terracotta), Text: `#FFF` (white), Hover: `#B25540` (darker terracotta).

---

### **🖼 4. Image & Visual Enhancements**

Since your product page has a **clean, neutral backdrop**, you want the **homepage to feel warm and inviting**:  
✅ Use **high-quality lifestyle images** with **soft lighting** to match your elegant colors.  
✅ Consider **subtle gradients or textures** in the hero banner to **add depth**.  
✅ Product cards should have **soft shadows (#D3D1CA)** to subtly separate them from the background.
